# Jfrog home test

It's actually been a few a good few months since i used python and this exercise forced me to learn some new things and remind myself things ive forgotten. 
it also reminded me that i really enjoy the logic and problem solving that writing code brings, so thank you for this exciting opportunity and i hope we will be a match :)

As far as the desicsion that i've made, im not sure as how to expand on them since i just wrote what i know..and due to my experince level im probably not aware of other more efficent ways ways to write this.
if i got stuck beyond the documantation sources or forgot the syntax of something i Googled until i found something that provided me with a good guidance or example which i could  somehow apply on my own code, nothing was copied blindly.

Sources i used were -
